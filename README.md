# KNN
An attempt at writing KNN Machine Learning Algorithm from scratch using python.
The dataset used is Iris dataset.
There are two versions currently, one is with a graphical representation output and the other with a normal terminal based output. Both of these are to be combined and a single fluid code file is to be expected soon.
